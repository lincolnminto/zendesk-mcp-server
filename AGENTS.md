# AGENTS.md — Working guide for AI agents

**Purpose & scope.** This file orients an LLM working in this repo: where things
live and the rules that aren't obvious from the code. It is **not** user
documentation.

- **Don't document what the code already shows.** File-by-file trees, command
  listings, env-var tables, setup steps — the agent reads those from the source,
  `package.json` or the docs faster than it trusts a prose copy here, and
  duplicating them only burns context and goes stale.
- Keep each section short — durable rules and pointers, not reference material.
  When a section grows into setup steps, command listings or exhaustive detail,
  it's user-facing (→ `README.md`) or a deep dive (→ `docs/`): link it, don't
  inline it.

Toolchain (Node 24 + pnpm 11) is the dev floor; the published package still runs on Node 20+ (a CI job exercises the packed tarball on Node 20).

On **Claude Code on the web**, the Node environment is set up automatically at session start (dependencies installed), so tests and linters work right away.

**Iterating on tool code?** Start the server with `--dev` (stdio) to expose a `reload_tools` tool. After editing a `src/tools/*.ts` file, call `reload_tools` to re-register the whole toolset over the live session — the edit takes effect with no restart and no client reconnect. Details in `docs/configuration.md` (Dev mode).

## Claim before you build — no duplicate work

Parallel duplicate work has happened here. Before coding an issue: re-read it
live (closed `completed` / `released` → it already shipped, stop); search open
*and* merged PRs for its number (`is:pr #<n>`) — coordinate on an open one,
don't fork; then self-assign, drop a "picking this up" comment, and open your PR
as a draft early. Link the issue in the PR **description** with a closing keyword
(`Closes #<n>` — not `Implements`/bare `#<n>`, which don't close it) so it
auto-closes on squash-merge to `main`. Need a follow-up on already-shipped work?
Open a *new* issue for the delta. Fuller checklist in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

## Architecture

Transports: stdio (SDK `StdioServerTransport`) plus a thin `node:http` HTTP
transport that wraps `StreamableHTTPServerTransport` and serves the RFC 9728 /
RFC 8414 OAuth discovery endpoints; HTTP builds a per-session `McpServer` so the
request's bearer is captured in the tools' closure — no shared state.

**Tool modes** (chosen at startup by `--mode`): `all` (every tool individually),
`namespace` (default — one proxy per namespace), `single` (one `zendesk` proxy).
Proxies take `{ operation, params }` and validate `params` through the original
Zod schema. Each proxy dispatches only within its own scoped handler map, so a
`zendesk_tickets` proxy cannot invoke a `help_center` operation. `--namespace` /
`--read-only` / `--tool` are applied by `filterTools` *before* the mode switch;
`--tool` also forces `mode: all` (`config.ts`).

Every Zendesk API request goes through `performFetch` in `client/zendesk-api.ts`
(the OAuth token exchange in `auth/browser-oauth.ts` deliberately does not), so retry and
network-error wrapping are decided once, in `client/retry.ts`: a new client method must
pick its row in that policy table, where a write is never replayed once it may have
reached Zendesk. Why the loop is ours rather than a library's — and what would change
that: `docs/decisions/client-retry.md`.

**Auth** — stdio auto-detects the mode: OAuth 2.1 PKCE (`token-store.ts`, lazy
browser flow) by default, or static Basic auth (`auth/api-token.ts`) when both
`ZENDESK_EMAIL` and `ZENDESK_API_TOKEN` are set — a headless/CI escape hatch,
never a shared-account mode. HTTP: per-session bearer captured from
`Authorization:` only; API-token config is **refused at boot** there (a shared
static credential would expose every caller to the issuing user's rights). Why
this reopens a prior OAuth-only decision, and what stays off the table:
`docs/decisions/api-token-auth.md`.

Local setup and auth flows live in `README.md`; CLI flags and env vars in
`docs/configuration.md`; remote HTTP deployment in `docs/http-deployment.md`;
troubleshooting in `docs/troubleshooting.md`; manual tool testing in
`docs/live-testing.md`.

## Design principle — usage-first, not API-shaped

Design every tool for what an LLM needs to accomplish a real task, not for what
the Zendesk API happens to expose. The API's endpoints, names, pagination and
data shapes are an implementation detail, not a template — they may be awkward or
built for a use case that isn't ours. Don't mirror them 1:1, and don't copy other
MCP servers just because they exist; neither is evidence of what serves the LLM.
A single tool may fan out to several Zendesk calls and join, reshape or drop the
result to hand back exactly what the use case needs — that cross-calling is
expected, not a smell. When API shape and usage pull apart, follow the usage. (This
never overrides the multi-agent rule below: internal naming coherence and the
quality bar still hold — the freedom is from Zendesk's shape, not from craft.)

## Testing

- New features: TDD — failing test first. Bug fixes: reproduce with a test first.
- Existing tests are sacred: a failure is a potential regression — find the root
  cause before touching the test.
- Mock Zendesk with MSW (`tests/msw-handlers.ts`), never the real API.
- Exact-output assertions go through `toMatchInlineSnapshot`, **committed
  filled** — an empty one is auto-filled, passes, and kills no mutant. A `-u` on a
  formatter changes what an agent reads back: treat it as a behaviour change and
  justify it. Rule: `CONTRIBUTING.md` (Code standards).
- Extend `tests/integration/` when you add/change a tool, mode, filter or
  transport; shared behaviour goes in `registerCoreScenarios`. Coverage
  thresholds in `vitest.config.ts` are a ratchet.
- Inter-LLM functional tests (proxy annotations, `[RO]` prefix on `tools/list`)
  live in `tests/functional/`; invoke via `/functional-testing`. Details in
  `tests/functional/README.md`.
- Mutation testing (StrykerJS) runs over the scope in `stryker.config.mjs`, and
  CI fails a PR on a mutant that survived **in a line it changed**
  (`pnpm test:mutation:diff origin/main HEAD` reproduces it). A survivor means an
  assertion is missing or too loose — tighten it, never weaken one to go green;
  for a genuinely equivalent mutant say why with
  `// Stryker disable next-line <mutator>: <reason>`. Rationale, scope and costs:
  `docs/decisions/mutation-testing.md`.

## Planning

An implementation plan that changes **MCP-runtime-observable behaviour** — the
tool surface, transports, auth, resources, prompts, persistence or timing a
running server exposes to a client — must also carry a **functional validation
plan** for that behaviour, written for an *independent* validator (another agent
or a human), not the implementer. It lives in the PR description; the validator
posts their report as a PR comment (English). Author the plan with the
`functional-validation-plan` skill; the validator executes it with the
`run-validation-plan` skill — don't inline either here.

**Pure tooling / dev-tooling changes are exempt** — build scripts, the
typecheck/lint/format setup, dev-only scripts, CI and release automation change
nothing a client observes at runtime, so the standard gates (`pnpm typecheck` /
`pnpm check` / `pnpm test` + CI) *are* the validation; no third-party pass. The
test: if a running server behaves no differently for a client, it's tooling.

## Code style

- TypeScript strict; Biome for lint/format (`pnpm check`).
- Keep the `!!**/node_modules` force-ignore in `biome.json` `files.includes`: it
  stops Biome 2's scanner from opening every dependency file for its module graph
  (~40% of `pnpm check` wall time, worse on slow filesystems), and excludes them
  from the *scan*, not the *lint* — diagnostics here are unchanged. Revisit if a
  type-aware rule needs dependency types. `biome.json` rejects comments, hence
  this note.
- Lint runs on every edit, formatting only at pre-commit (`lefthook.yml`). Keep
  `--skip=types` on the `PostToolUse` hook — those two rules dominate its cost
  and pre-commit still enforces them. Don't add formatting back to the per-edit
  hook. Why: `docs/decisions/lint-tooling.md`.
- Lint and format through the pnpm scripts (`pnpm check`, `pnpm check:fix`);
  automated callers go through `scripts/biome.mjs`, never
  `node_modules/.bin/biome`, which has no binary to run on Android/Termux.
  Why, and what the shim does: `docs/decisions/biome-on-android.md`.
- Enable a lint rule only once the tree is already clean for it, so `pnpm check`
  stays green in the same commit. Which rules are on, and a line on every rule
  that is off: `docs/decisions/biome-rules.md`. `nursery` and the `types` domain
  are closed by policy — read that file before proposing either.
- Functional: pure functions, immutable data, no classes (except `ZendeskApiError`).
- Tool handlers are standalone functions in `ToolDefinition[]` arrays.
- ASCII-only error messages on auth paths — `node:http` rejects non-ASCII bytes
  in `WWW-Authenticate` and other headers (`ERR_INVALID_CHAR`), which surfaces
  as a 500 instead of the spec-required 401.

## Communication language

GitHub (PRs, commits, comments, code) in **English**. Chat follows the user's language.

## Multi-agent compatibility — absolute rule

Must work with every mainstream MCP agent; no PR may degrade one. Every **new
tool** must meet the Glama Tool Definition Quality bar (clear purpose, usage
guidelines, stated side effects, per-parameter `.describe()`) and keep the tool
set coherent (naming, disambiguation, no needless duplication) — the server
score is `60% mean + 40% min`, so one weak tool drags the whole surface down.
Every **tool change** must keep what agents depend on in the exposed JSON Schema
(draft-07): never drop a field or loosen a type, and never drop what a
description said — though saying it in fewer words is a win, and fixing a false
one is a duty. Criteria, the checklist and how to diff the schema:
`docs/mcp-metadata.md`.

## Documentation maintenance

Any change to the tool surface syncs the tool tables in
`docs/mcp-tools-reference.md` (and, if a whole namespace appears or disappears,
the namespace list in the `README.md` "Tool surface" section) in the same PR.
Prose and section headers are deliberately count-free (no per-section
`(N tools)` or global tool totals) — don't reintroduce hardcoded counts, they
only go stale. Exact counts still live where they're load-bearing: namespace
counts in `tests/unit/routing/registry.test.ts` and the length assertions in
`tests/unit/tools/*.test.ts` — update those. Proxy descriptions surface only the
first sentence of a tool's description — keep it standalone. Changes to the
non-tool MCP surface (server `instructions`, `resources`, `prompts`) sync
`docs/help-center-context.md` in the same PR — that's where the mechanics,
per-flag toggles and request costs live; the `README.md` section is a short
"why" summary and only changes when the pitch does.

The `README.md` is deliberately **why/what, not how**: keep setup mechanics,
flags, costs and internals in `docs/` and link them. Don't restate a point the
README already makes elsewhere — the FAQ in particular is not a place to repeat
the body.

## Submission quality bar

Before opening a PR, clear the **Submission quality bar** in
[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md#submission-quality-bar) (same bar for human
and AI authors).

## Release workflow

Fully automated via semantic-release on push to `main`; never hand-bump
`version` in `package.json` or the version-controlled `server.json` — release
syncs both. Reseed `server.json` with `pnpm build:server-json` when its metadata
changes. Details: `docs/release-automation.md`.
