# MCP tools reference: Zendesk MCP Server

The complete tool-by-tool reference for the [Zendesk MCP Server](../README.md),
grouped by namespace. Each tool is exposed according to the active `--mode`
(`all` exposes every tool individually; `namespace` and `single` wrap them in
proxies). See [Tool surface](../README.md#tool-surface) in the README for how
modes and the `--namespace` / `--tool` filters shape the surface.

The **Mode** column marks each tool as `read` or `write`; `--read-only` filters
out every `write` tool before the proxies are built.

<details>
<summary><strong>Tickets</strong></summary>

| Tool | Description | Mode |
|------|-------------|------|
| `get_ticket` | Retrieve a ticket by ID with optional comments and its live SLA state (resolved via a scoped search); the thread comes back whole, so reach for `list_ticket_comments` on a long one | read |
| `list_ticket_comments` | Read a ticket's conversation (public replies and internal notes, full bodies) newest-first and cursor-paginated, with comment ids and authors resolved to names — the paged alternative to `get_ticket(include_comments=true)` on a long thread | read |
| `get_ticket_history` | Read a ticket's change history (audit trail) as a chronological, oldest-first timeline of who changed what and when: field changes as before → after with actor names, comment presence (not bodies), system noise filtered; cursor-paginated | read |
| `get_ticket_attachments` | Download ticket attachments. Images are delivered as native multimodal content for the client's own model to analyze; oversize/over-limit images and non-images come back as text references | read |
| `search_tickets` | Search tickets using Zendesk query syntax, with per-result SLA state | read |
| `list_tickets` | List tickets with cursor-based pagination | read |
| `get_linked_incidents` | Get incidents linked to a problem ticket | read |
| `list_sla_policies` | List SLA policies with filter conditions and per-priority targets (requires an admin token, or a custom role with the SLA-management permission) | read |
| `list_ticket_fields` | List ticket field definitions (system + custom) with ids, types, and dropdown/multiselect option values, to resolve `custom_fields` ids and accepted values for create_ticket / update_ticket | read |
| `list_views` | List the agent's active views (saved ticket queues) with best-effort (cached, may show "(count updating)") ticket counts, to see where the workload sits before opening a queue | read |
| `get_view_tickets` | Read the tickets inside a view (by title or id) in the view's own configured sort order, cursor-paginated (no live SLA block; use search_tickets for that) | read |
| `list_macros` | List the active macros available to the authenticated user, with each macro's id, title, scope, and ordered actions | read |
| `create_ticket` | Create a new ticket with subject, description, priority, tags... | write |
| `update_ticket` | Update ticket status, priority, assignee, tags, custom fields | write |
| `add_private_note` | Add an internal note (not visible to requester), optionally with file attachments | write |
| `add_public_comment` | Add a public comment (visible to requester), optionally with file attachments | write |
| `manage_tags` | Add or remove tags on a ticket | write |
| `preview_macro_diff` | Preview a macro's changes to a ticket as a before → after diff (only changed fields + reply), without saving; commit via update_ticket / add_public_comment / add_private_note | write |
