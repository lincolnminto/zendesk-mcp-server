# MCP tool metadata: Glama criteria & multi-agent safety

This is the deep dive behind the **Multi-agent compatibility** rule in
[`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md). It answers two questions every tool change must
clear:

1. **New tool.** Does its definition meet the quality bar the [Glama
   score](https://glama.ai/mcp/servers/lincolnminto/zendesk-mcp-server) grades us on?
2. **Tool change.** Does the JSON Schema we expose to agents still carry
   everything an agent could depend on (no regression)?

The Glama score is the badge at the top of `README.md`; it is a public,
agent-facing signal of how usable our tools are, so we treat its criteria as a
contract, not a vanity metric.

## Glama score, in one screen

The overall score is **Tool Definition Quality (70 %) + Server Coherence (30 %)**.
The weights and dimensions below are from Glama's public methodology
([glama.ai/mcp/methodology](https://glama.ai/mcp/methodology), retrieved
2026-07-01). Re-check it if the score moves, since the rubric may evolve.

### Tool Definition Quality, 70 %

How well *each individual tool* describes itself to an AI agent. Every tool is
scored 1 to 5 on six dimensions:

| Dimension | Weight | What it asks |
|---|---|---|
| Purpose Clarity | 25 % | Is it obvious what the tool does and when to reach for it? |
| Usage Guidelines | 20 % | Does the description say when to use it (and when not)? |
| Behavioral Transparency | 20 % | Are side effects, mutations and failure modes stated? |
| Parameter Semantics | 15 % | Does every param have a `.describe()` that explains meaning, format and constraints, rather than restating the name? |
| Conciseness & Structure | 10 % | Is it complete without padding? |
| Contextual Completeness | 10 % | Enough context to call it correctly without reading the source? |

**Aggregation matters:** the server-level score is **60 % mean + 40 % minimum**
across all tools. One poorly described tool drags the whole server down, so a new
tool is not "good enough because the average is fine". It must stand on its own.

### Server Coherence, 30 %

How well the tools work together *as a set*. Four dimensions, weighted equally:

- Disambiguation: can an agent tell two similar tools apart from their
  descriptions? (e.g. `search` vs `search_tickets` vs `search_articles`.)
- Naming consistency: verbs, casing and namespace prefixes follow the same
  pattern as the existing surface.
- Tool count appropriateness: no needless proliferation, and an optional param
  beats a near-duplicate tool (this is why PR #110 added `attachments` to the two
  comment tools instead of a new `upload_file` tool).
- Completeness: no obvious gaps a caller would expect to exist.

## Checklist for a new tool

- Description leads with a **standalone first sentence**, because proxy modes
  surface only that sentence (see `AGENTS.md` → Documentation maintenance).
- Every parameter has a meaningful `.describe()` (Parameter Semantics).
- Description states side effects / mutations and what the tool returns
  (Behavioral Transparency), and when to use vs. avoid it (Usage Guidelines).
- Name matches the existing verb/prefix convention (Naming Consistency).
- Adding a param to an existing tool beats a near-duplicate tool (Tool Count).
- Sync the `docs/mcp-tools-reference.md` tool tables in the same PR.

## How this is enforced (floor + ceiling)

The rubric is ~60 % mechanically-checkable structure and ~40 % judgment, so we
enforce it in two layers instead of relying on a human catching every thin tool:

- **The deterministic floor, `tests/unit/tools/tool-quality.test.ts`.** A CI test
  (sibling of `annotations.test.ts`) that iterates every tool and fails, with a
  teaching message, when a definition drops below the floor:
  - every parameter has a `.describe()` that adds information beyond the field
    name (not `ticket_id` → "Ticket ID");
  - the tool `description` is more than one sentence;
  - a write tool (`readOnly: false`) states its effect / return value.

  This guards the **`40 % minimum`** term of the server score, so no single tool
  can crater the surface. The failure messages state the intent and point at an
  exemplar tool on purpose: fix by genuinely improving the definition, not by
  padding text to clear the check (padding is caught by the ceiling below).
- **The judgment ceiling, CodeRabbit (`.coderabbit.yaml`).** The `src/tools/**`
  review instructions ask CodeRabbit to score each definition against the six
  dimensions and flag what a static check can't: padded-but-empty descriptions,
  implicit side effects, unverified claims about Zendesk behavior, and
  indistinguishable sibling tools. This runs on the PR, off our pipeline.

When you add or change a tool, run `pnpm test` locally; the floor test tells you
exactly which dimension regressed.

## No regression on a tool change

Agents consume our Zod schemas as **JSON Schema draft-07**. We author schemas
with `zod/v4` (see `src/tools/*`); the MCP SDK serializes them to draft-07
internally via zod v4's mini/`toJSONSchema` path, so you don't import `v4-mini`
yourself. A change is *multi-agent-safe* only when the exposed schema keeps
everything an agent could depend on:

- **Never drop what a description said** — unless it became false, where fixing
  it outranks preserving it. Fewer words for the same facts is a win: this is
  prompt text, re-read on every `tools/list`, not a contract.
- **Never drop** a `required` field or loosen a type in a way that changes the
  emitted schema shape.
- **Adding constraints is an enrichment, not a regression.** Tightening
  `z.string().min(1)` to `z.string().min(1).base64()` only *adds* `format` and
  `pattern` to the draft-07 output and leaves the `description` byte-for-byte
  identical (verified on PR #110). That is exactly the kind of change we want.

**How to verify:** dump the tool's JSON Schema before and after the change and
diff it. Keys and constraints must be additive only; a field that disappears or
a type that loosens is a regression. Stop and rethink. For a `description` that
differs, ask what an agent knew before and no longer knows — nothing missing is
fine, however much shorter. One that may only ever grow fails
`Conciseness & Structure` above.
