# Release automation

This document describes how dependency updates and releases are automated in this repository.

## Flow overview

semantic-release scans commits since the last release
        │
        ├─ commit `fix(security): …`   → patch release published on npm + GitHub
        ├─ commit `fix: …`              → patch release
        ├─ commit `feat: …`             → minor release
        ├─ commit `BREAKING CHANGE`     → major release
        └─ commit `chore(deps): …`      → ignored (no release)
        │
        ▼ (when a release was cut)
Mirror the release into the official MCP registry
```

The commit-type → release-level mapping lives in `.releaserc.json` (preset `conventionalcommits`).

## MCP registry publishing

After semantic-release runs, the same `release.yml` job mirrors the release into
the [official MCP registry](https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io) under the
name `io.github.lincolnminto/zendesk-mcp-server`, so registry-driven MCP clients pick up
each new version automatically.

- **Gating.** `@semantic-release/npm` rewrites `package.json`'s `version` in the
  working tree only when it actually publishes. The job snapshots the version
  before and after semantic-release; the publish steps run **only** when it
  changed, so `chore:` / `docs:` pushes (no release) never touch the registry.
- **Manifest.** `server.json` is **version-controlled** at the repo root
  (committed and reviewable). [`scripts/build-server-json.mjs`](../scripts/build-server-json.mjs)
  *seeds* it from everything that already lives in `package.json` (name from
  `mcpName`, npm identifier, version, repository, homepage) plus the
  registry/launch specifics (schema, transport, subdomain argument, env);
  regenerate the committed file with `pnpm build:server-json` whenever that
  metadata changes. A unit test asserts the committed file equals what the
  generator would seed, so it cannot drift from `package.json`.
- **Version sync.** At release, semantic-release does **not** regenerate the
  manifest; a `@semantic-release/exec` `prepareCmd` runs
  [`scripts/sync-server-json-version.mjs`](../scripts/sync-server-json-version.mjs)
  to update **only** the `version` fields to `${nextRelease.version}`, and
  `@semantic-release/git` commits `server.json` alongside `CHANGELOG.md` and
  `package.json`. The release commit therefore carries a clean one-line version
  diff, and `package.json` / `server.json` versions can never diverge. The
  MCP-registry publish step reads this committed, freshly-bumped file directly;
  there is no generate-from-scratch step in the release job.
- **Ownership.** The registry proves npm ownership via the `mcpName` field in
  `package.json` (which the generator uses as the `server.json` `name`).
- **Auth.** `mcp-publisher login github-oidc` reuses the workflow's
  `id-token: write` GitHub OIDC token, the same permission npm Trusted
  Publishing already relies on. No new secret, and the `io.github.lincolnminto/*`
  namespace is authorized because the workflow runs in `lincolnminto`'s repo.
- **Resilience.** The publish is retried a few times to absorb npm propagation
  lag (the registry validates by fetching the freshly published npm tarball).

## Release notes content

semantic-release generates the notes from **every** commit between the previous
tag and the release commit, including the non-triggering ones (`chore`, `ci`,
`build`, `test`, `refactor`, `docs`, `style`). The `conventionalcommits` preset
hides those types in its default type list (`effect: 'hidden'`), so they never
surfaced in any changelog even though they belong to a release range. The
`presetConfig.types` array in `.releaserc.json` replaces that list wholesale, and
an entry without an `effect` defaults to visible. That is why the types are
listed there with a `section` and nothing else.

To keep them visible without drowning the consumer-facing notes (especially the
Renovate `chore(deps)` churn), the `release-notes-generator` step is replaced by a
thin local wrapper, [`scripts/release-notes-collapsed.js`](../scripts/release-notes-collapsed.js).
It calls the official generator, then post-processes the markdown:

- The public sections (Features, Bug Fixes, Performance Improvements, Reverts,
  `⚠ BREAKING CHANGES`) stay at the top.
- The internal sections, meaning the non-triggering types above, are grouped into
  a single collapsed `<details>` block placed underneath.

No Handlebars template is reimplemented: the wrapper only reorganizes rendered
markdown, so it is insensitive to *how* the preset renders. It does not, however,
shield the pipeline from the preset ↔ writer coupling below. The collapsed section
titles and the `<summary>` label are configurable via the `collapsedSections` /
`collapsedSummary` plugin options in `.releaserc.json`. The wrapper requires
`@semantic-release/release-notes-generator` as an explicit devDependency (kept on
the same major as the one `semantic-release` bundles).

### Preset / writer version coupling

`conventional-changelog-conventionalcommits` v10 replaced Handlebars template
strings with render functions. Only `conventional-changelog-writer@9` understands
that shape, while `@semantic-release/release-notes-generator@14` (latest) still
declares `conventional-changelog-writer@^8`. Paired as published, writer 8 finds no
`mainTemplate` and renders **only the version header**: a release would still be
cut, with an empty CHANGELOG and GitHub Release. Upstream issue:
[semantic-release/release-notes-generator#992](https://github.com/semantic-release/release-notes-generator/issues/992).

`pnpm-workspace.yaml` therefore overrides the writer to `^9.2.0`. The override is
unscoped because `@semantic-release/commit-analyzer` declares the writer but never
imports it (it reads only the preset's `parserOpts`; release levels come from its
own default release rules), so forcing the writer cannot affect version detection,
only rendering. Verified on real repository history: the generated notes are
byte-identical to the pre-upgrade output.

**Removal condition:** drop the override once `release-notes-generator` publishes a
version depending on `conventional-changelog-writer@^9`. The canary assertions in
`tests/unit/release-notes-preset-render.test.ts` are what detects a broken pairing,
in either direction.

Until then the entry is kept current like any other override: Renovate tracks it
and auto-merges its patch / minor bumps (the `pnpm.overrides` row in the auto-merge
policy below), a major would land in the Dependency Dashboard for approval, and
either way the canary gates the merge.

## Auto-merge policy

| Update kind                                       | Vulnerability (security) | Non-vulnerability        |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| **patch** on `dependencies` (prod)                | auto-merge               | manual review            |
| **minor** on `dependencies` (prod)                | manual review            | manual review            |
| **patch** on `devDependencies`                    | auto-merge               | auto-merge               |
| **minor** on `devDependencies`                    | manual review\*          | auto-merge               |
| **major** (any deps, prod and dev)                | dashboard approval       | dashboard approval       |
| **patch / minor** on `pnpm` (`packageManager`)    | auto-merge               | auto-merge               |
| **patch / minor** on `pnpm.overrides` entries     | auto-merge               | auto-merge               |
| Weekly `lockFileMaintenance` (Friday before 8am, Europe/Paris) | auto-merge | auto-merge |
| GitHub Actions (`uses: org/action@…`)             | manual review            | manual review            |

\* Vulnerability-minor updates carry the `fix(security):` prefix, so merging them publishes a release. We keep them under manual review to allow an impact assessment first.

**Dashboard approval** means: no PR is opened automatically. The update appears in the Renovate-managed "Dependency Dashboard" issue with a checkbox. Ticking the checkbox triggers PR creation. This is intentional for majors, which usually require reading the upstream CHANGELOG and following a migration procedure.

Concrete examples:

- Patch vulnerability in `hono` (prod) → PR `fix(security): update hono to X` → auto-merge → patch release published.
- Minor vulnerability in `hono` (prod) → PR `fix(security): update hono to X` → **manual review** → patch release published on merge.
- Major vulnerability in `hono` (prod) → **no auto PR**, entry in the dashboard awaiting approval.
- Minor update of `vitest` (devDep) → PR `chore(deps): update vitest to X` → auto-merge → no release.
- Major update of `vitest` (devDep) → entry in the dashboard, manual approval required.
- Patch or minor bump of `pnpm` (via `packageManager` field) → PR `chore(deps): update pnpm to X` → auto-merge → no release. The corepack hash in `packageManager` is updated automatically by Renovate when the format is `pnpm@VERSION+sha512.HASH`.
- Non-vuln patch update of `hono` (prod) → PR `chore(deps): update hono to X` → manual review → no release on merge.
- GitHub Action digest bump → PR `chore(deps): update actions/X` → manual review → no release.
- Weekly Friday lockfile maintenance (before 8am, Europe/Paris) → PR `chore(deps): lock file maintenance` → auto-merge → no release. Picks up transitive updates whose parent ranges already allow the new version (e.g. a `^3.0.1`-ranged transitive moving from 3.1.0 to 3.1.2).

## Admin prerequisites (out-of-PR settings)

These cannot be versioned; a repository (or org) admin must apply them **once**:

1. **Install the Renovate GitHub App** on the repository via https://github.com/apps/renovate. No secret to create.
2. **Settings → General → Pull Requests**:
   - Allow auto-merge ✓
   - Allow squash merging ✓
   - Default to PR title for squash merges ✓ (**critical**: without this, the `fix(security):` prefix is not carried into the squash commit on `main`, and no release is published)
3. **Settings → Rules → Rulesets**: one ruleset on `main` carrying every rule.
   Five of them, and re-creating the ruleset means re-creating all five:
   - Require a pull request before merging, squash the only allowed method,
     zero required approvals, conversation resolution required.
   - Required status checks `build-and-test`, `Changed lines` and `CodeQL`, with
     "require branches to be up to date" on. (Without the status-check rule,
     `platformAutomerge` would merge the PR before CI finishes; without the
     up-to-date policy, a PR behind `main` can auto-merge on stale green checks.)
   - Restrict deletions, and block force pushes.
   - Bypass list: the `fruggr-release-bot` App (point 4), bypass mode "always".
     Not "pull request" — that mode would still force the release commit
     through a PR, which is the thing being avoided.
   - Two constraints explain that shape. A bypass actor skips the rules of the
     ruleset it is listed on and nothing else, so splitting the rules over two
     rulesets means maintaining two bypass entries. And the rules cannot live in
     a classic branch protection rule, which has no bypass list at all: the
     `chore(release)` commit `semantic-release` pushes to `main` gets refused
     with `GH006`, both by the pull-request rule and by the status checks, since
     `build-and-test` and `Changed lines` only run on `pull_request` and no
     check can report on a commit the remote just refused. Neither rulesets nor
     classic protection honour `[skip ci]`; only a bypass actor gets through.
4. **A dedicated GitHub App, `fruggr-release-bot`**, on that bypass list:
   - Repository permissions: Contents write for the push, the tag and the
     release; Issues and Pull requests write for the comments
     `@semantic-release/github` posts. No webhook, installed on this repo only.
   - The private key goes in `RELEASE_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`, a secret of a **`release`
     environment** whose deployment branch policy admits `main` only, never a
     repository secret. `release.yml` names that environment and exchanges the
     key for a one-hour installation token through
     `actions/create-github-app-token` (revoked in post-job). The boundary is the
     point: repository secrets are readable by a workflow run on any branch, and
     the App bypasses every rule in the ruleset, so a branch that could read the
     key could push anything to `main` unchecked.
   - The App's Client ID goes in the repository variable
     `RELEASE_APP_CLIENT_ID`. It is public (`GET /apps/{slug}` serves it to
     anyone), so it is a variable, not a secret. Use it with the action's
     `client-id` input; `app-id` still works but is deprecated.
   - The ruleset grants no bypass to admins, so there is no manual fallback:
     a maintainer with a PAT gets the same `GH006` as `GITHUB_TOKEN`. Recovering
     a stuck release means fixing the App path, or temporarily adding a bypass
     actor. If required signed commits are ever enabled, remember that
     `semantic-release` pushes through the git CLI and signs nothing, so that
     rule has to sit in the bypassed ruleset too.
5. **Settings → Code security → Dependabot security updates**: OFF. Renovate takes over via `vulnerabilityAlerts` (GHSA) + `osvVulnerabilityAlerts` (Google OSV), and we avoid duplicate PRs.

## Pause or disable

- **Pause Renovate on this repo**: add `"enabled": false` at the root of `renovate.json` and commit, or tick "rate limited" in the Dependency Dashboard.
- **Disable auto-merge globally**: replace `"platformAutomerge": true` with `false` in `renovate.json`. PRs keep being opened, but must be merged manually.
- **Disable auto-merge for one category**: remove `"automerge": true` from the relevant `packageRules` entry.

## Future broadening

Once test coverage is deemed sufficient to automate more widely:

- Auto-merge non-vuln prod `dependencies` patches by adding to `packageRules`:
  ```json
  {
    "matchDepTypes": ["dependencies"],
    "matchUpdateTypes": ["patch"],
    "automerge": true
  }
  ```
- Auto-merge GitHub Actions patches: replace the current `github-actions` rule with one matching `matchUpdateTypes: ["patch"]` and `automerge: true`.

Keep majors at `dependencyDashboardApproval: true`: they almost always require reading the upstream CHANGELOG.
